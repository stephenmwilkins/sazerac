        <h1>SAZERAC 2.0</h1>
        <h3><b>w/c: 14 June 2021</b></h3>
        <h5><b>Location:</b> Zoom, YouTube, and Slack</h5>
      </div>


      <div class="container" >
        <div style="height:20px"></div>
        <p>Last year at this time we created the Summer All-Zoom Epoch of Reionization Astronomy Conference (SAZERAC) to react to the sudden consequences of the cancellation of the summer conference circuit due to COVID-19.  While we are still in the midst of the pandemic, the astronomical community has rapidly adapted and there are now several online conference offerings planned for summer 2021.  As SAZERAC was extremely enjoyable and well received, we are announcing SAZERAC 2, to take place the week of 14 June.</p>

        <p>Participation in SAZERAC will be entirely online via zoom, with the option to pre-record talks.  All talks will be recorded and posted on our website for later viewing. Discussion and interaction will be facilitated via Slack, enabling those in conflicting time zones or who cannot attend live to interact with speakers and participate in all discussions. </p>

        <p>Talk sessions at SAZERAC will focus on variety of topics, observational and theoretical, spanning the epoch of reionization (broadly z > 5), including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Evolution of cosmic star formation</li>
          <li>Physical conditions of galaxy star-forming environments</li>
          <li>Constraints on reionization</li>
          <li>Formation of the first stars and black holes</li>
          <li>Local analogues of high-redshift galaxies</li>
          <li>Near-future surveys of the Epoch of Reionization</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The format for SAZERAC 2 will broadly be similar to the original.  To overcome timezone and childcare constraints, we will meet for 3.5 hours (two 90 minute sessions and 30 min break) each day over four days, beginning on 14 June.  These sessions will begin at 1330 UTC (0630/0930 US West/East Coast, 1430 in UK, 2230 in Tokyo).  We will also hold an additional session beginning 0800 UTC on Wednesday 16 June to provide more reasonable access for speakers from East Asia, South East Asia, and Australasia. The Slack channel allows discussions to continue across time zones.  Similar to last year, talks by junior researchers will be prioritized, though we will also welcome some talks by more senior researchers.  Finally, we anticipate one session focused on relevant JWST Cycle 1 approved programs.</p>

        <!-- <p>To register as a speaker or participant please <a>click here</a>. Registration is limited to ~300 based on zoom constraints, and zoom is required for access to the sessions. The deadline for registration is <b>Friday 30 April</b>, and we will endeavor to notify selected speakers no later than 14 May. </p> -->

        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p>Attendance at SAZERAC is not a right but a privilege, and attendees are expected to behave professionally. The SAZERAC organizers are committed to providing an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas.</p>

        <p>This document establishes a code of conduct for all attendees of SAZERAC.  By participating in SAZERAC in any way, including as an attendee, a presenter, or an organizer, you agree to abide by this code of conduct.  Failure to adhere to this code of conduct in all SAZERAC-related circumstances, including in the main session webinars, in the Slack channels, other SAZERAC-related events, or any in person, telephone, or other electronic communication related to SAZERAC, will result in removal from all conference events.</p>

        <p>Our scientific community values all members, regardless of (alphabetically) age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender expression, gender identity, marital status, nationality, physical appearance, political affiliation, pregnancy, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and status as a caregiver (including as a parent).  The ability of SAZERAC to allow our community to share its research results and promote the careers of junior attendees depends critically on maintaining a culture of inclusivity, where all voices are respected and heard.</p>

        <p>SAZERAC will not tolerate verbal, nonverbal, physical, or sexual harassment or bullying of any kind. Behavior and language acceptable to one person may not be to another. Unwelcome attention, threatening or abusive language, insulting, hurtful, or disrespectful comments, are strictly banned from SAZERAC. Members must make every effort to ensure that words and actions communicate respect for others, regardless of opinion regarding the person or their scientific results.</p>

        <p>SAZERAC places a high priority on eliminating sexual harassment in any form from the workplace.  As a rule, sexual advancements should not take place in any professional setting, including social events related to a professional event. Members should be especially conscientious of real or perceived power gradients such as seniority, status, or reputation, that may place a member in a vulnerable position.</p>

        <p>SAZERAC is not a public event.  All attendees must register via the website, and should not share the connection information to Zoom or Slack with non-registered people.  When connecting to Zoom or slack, all attendees should use their own name, and not attempt to misrepresent themselves.</p>

        <p>During SAZERAC sessions, the Session Chair is in charge.  Speakers must keep to their allotted time, ideally using a timer.  If they exceed their time, their question time will be reduced, and if they speak through all of the question time, they will be disconnected.  When asking questions of speakers, please be professional, courteous, and polite.  If a participant engages in obvious harassing behavior during the presentations, the Chairs may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or removing them from the conference.</p>

        <p>SAZERAC participants who believe that they have witnessed or been negatively impacted by a possible violation of the Code of Conduct should contact the SOC by emailing <a href="malto:soc@sazerac-conference.org">soc@sazerac-conference.org</a> to initiate a complaint, including any available evidence (e.g., screenshots) in their email.  If a majority of the SOC concurs that this code has been violated, the offender will be immediately removed from all SAZERAC events.  The offender will then be contacted by the SOC, and will have the opportunity to appeal the decision.  This appeal will be considered by the SOC, whose decision will be final.</p>
