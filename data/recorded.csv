Thanks in part to its unique position above the Earth's atmosphere and five manned servicing missions it has maintained its position as one of the world’s premier observatories to this day. Over its 30 year career Hubble has had an unprecedented scientific and cultural impact; discoveries extending from the outer Solar System to the edge of the observable Universe have revolutionised our understanding of astronomy and cosmology while its spectacular images have inspired the wider public’s wonder.,https://youtu.be/8S-Y9yjm1zM,,Outreach and diversity,

This unconventional result originated from carefully tracking the small-scale structure to below jean mass prior to reionization with high-resolution simulations. As a result, one is able to track the HEMD (High-Entropy, Mean-Density) gas in mini-voids, which takes cosmological timescales to relax into the usual-temperature density relation of the IGM. Here, I will show how the memory of  inhomogeneous reionization in the Lya forest power spectra — currently a broadband systematic effect for the Lya forest community- could potentially become a window into the Epoch of Reionization.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozkUkRAPvHY,,"Reionization, Theory",

The first generation of stars were born a few hundred million years after the big bang. These stars synthesise elements heavier than H and He, which are later expelled into the interstellar medium, initiating the rise of metals. Within this enriched medium, the first dust grains were formed. This event is cosmologically crucial for molecule formation, as dust plays a major role by cooling low-metallicity star-forming clouds, which can fragment to create lower mass stars. Collecting information on these first dust grains is difficult because of the negative alliance of large distances and low dust masses.
Aims: We aim to combine the observational information from galaxies at redshifts 5 ≲ z ≲ 10 to constrain their dust emission and theoretically understand the first evolutionary phases of the dust cycle.
Methods: Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are fitted with CIGALE and the physical parameters and their evolution are modelled. From this SED fitting, we built a dust-emission template for this population of galaxies in the reionisation epoch.
Results: Our new models explain why some early galaxies are observed and others are not. We follow in time the formation of the first grains by supernovae later destroyed by other supernova blasts and expelled in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media.
Conclusions: We find evidence for the first dust grains formed in the universe. But above all, this work underlines the need to collect more data and to develop new facilities to further constrain the dust cycle in galaxies in the reionisation epoch.",https://youtu.be/eFJK2xrfbWg,,"First stars, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory, Observations",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a2FdmO3UOc6SgCeOikTb6qUqNoumPXUa

Here I present analysis of near-infrared HST imaging of six z=6 quasars, where a point source subtraction technique has been applied to obtain upper limits on the UV emission from their host galaxies. We also find nearby galaxies around five of these six quasars, suggesting that the quasars may be in high-density environments with ongoing merger activity. I will detail our plans to make follow-up observations of these quasars with our guaranteed-time on JWST, and explain how applying our analysis technique to JWST images should lead to the first near-infrared detections of z=6 quasar hosts.",https://youtu.be/nZOyZl86-UM,,"AGN, Observations",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FH11cyhpPrnNCfHChRJ3w23gU3aY2GUo
7/3/2020 10:35:42,valentin.mauerhofer@unige.ch,Valentin,Mauerhofer,University of Geneva,Absorption lines and escape fractions from  Ramses-RT simulations,"To understand the role of galaxies during the epoch of reionization, it is essential to know more about the values of the escape fractions of ionizing photons from those galaxies. Since the intergalactic medium was opaque to lyman continuum radiation during reionization, it will never be possible to observe directly the escape fraction, so we have to rely on indirect measurements. 
One potential method for an indirect measurement uses the absorption lines from low-ionization states of metal, like SiII 1260A, CII 1334A etc.  Those ions are good tracers of neutral hydrogen, and so the covering fraction measured from these absorption lines are thought to correlate well with the HI covering fraction. And, in turn, if the covering fraction of HI is less than unity, there are some low density channels in the ISM in which the ionizing photons can espace.
Our aim is to compute mock spectra of these absorption lines from simulated galaxies and correlate their spectral characteristics with the escape fraction of LyC radiation along that line of sight.

For this work I use a very high resolution Ramses-RT zoom simulation at redshift 3. I compute the density of several absorbers in all the cells with KROME, I use RASCAS to scatter the stellar light through the interstellar medium of these galaxies (since all the LIS lines considered are resonant lines with or without fluorescent re-emission). Finally, I build mock spectra in chosen directions of observation using the peeling-off technics, and measure several observables such as equivalent widths — in absorption and in emission through fluorescent channels—, the residual flux or velocities (Vmin at the maximum of absorption, Vmax the maximum velocity at which there is absorption).

I will present results on the correlations between these mock observables and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation. I will also highlight the fact that many properties of a galaxy, like escape fraction and absorption line shape, depend highly on the orientation of the galaxy. Finally, I will show the important role of dust, scattering effects and gas velocity in the formation of the absorption lines.",https://youtu.be/HrIBarmbWzI,,Escape fractions,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jLoNfliYLfpH6ED_9oNKI17W6_hkhKLW

Our understanding of reionization and galaxy evolution relies upon knowledge of the stellar populations and gas conditions in these early galaxies. In recent years Spitzer IRAC observations have revealed strong rest-optical emission in z>6 galaxies with [OIII]+Hbeta equivalent widths in excess of 800-1000A.  Such strong emission has also been seen in the spectra of ""Green Peas"" at z~0 and some star forming galaxies at z~2 where it is associated with elevated ionising photon production efficiencies and signifies upturns and bursts in star formation.  These conditions are thought to be conducive to larger escape fractions and hence these systems are more efficient ionising agents. Through modeling the [OIII] equivalent width distribution of the full population of z~2 star forming galaxies, we identify the highest-EW tail of the population, showing that these ideal ionisers are effectively absent in the general z~2 population. We present evidence for their redshift evolution towards Reionization, characterised by the increasing abundance of these ""extreme emission line galaxies"" and report their important role within this era.",https://youtu.be/LPCWmga8eUc,,"Analogues, Escape fractions",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wc7qoyA--NmXlmN4lGpPWQEurzBpWIS9

How do their interstellar medium (ISM) properties influence the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation? Answers to these questions hold the key to understand galaxy evolution.

In this talk I will present a novel method to simultaneously characterise the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the ISM properties of galaxies in the EoR through the combination of [CII] 158 μm and C III] λ1909 emission line data. The method allows us to determine the target galaxy average density, the gas metallicity, and 'burstiness' parameter, quantifying deviations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.

7/3/2020 18:43:24,benne.holwerda@gmail.com,Benne,Holwerda,University of Louisville,Sizes and Morphometrics of High-redshift Galaxies,"Redshift z = 9-10 object selection is the effective limit of Hubble Space Telescope imaging capability, even when confirmed with Spitzer. Spitzer confirmation is no longer possible and [3.6]-[4.5] color depends strongly on nebular emission. With only a few photometry data points are available, it becomes attractive to add criteria based on their morphology in these J- and H-band images. One could do so through visual inspection, a size criterion, or alternate morphometrics.
 
I explore a BoRG z~9-10 candidate galaxies and the object rejected
 by Morishita+ (2018) to explore the utility of a size criterion in z=9-10 candidate selection. Size and Gini-Asymmetry morphometrics all show promise as priors for the searches for high redshift sources in wide and shallow near-infrared space based imaging (e.g. Hubble, Euclid and Roman Space Telescopes). Size, morphometric and photometry combined form the data on which machine learning can identify high- redshift candidates instead of a visual inspection.

By running radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of reionization, I show that the suppression of the faint-end slope of the UV LF due to photoheating feedback of reionization is likely not detectable, owing to the sub-dominant role of photoheating feedback in regulating star formation compared to supernova feedback (1903.06167).  By generating mock photometry for the Simba simulations, we find that the early metal enrichment history in Simba results in good agreement with the observed UV LF at z=6, but produces too much dust extinction at z=8 so the simulated LF is quite a bit low.  This raises the discussion of the possibility of early metal enrichment, which will be testable with future JWST observations (1911.06330).",https://youtu.be/RR_7hDkIaow,,"Reionization, Star formation histories, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory, Observations, Tools",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WkRvZ_I32pLLtnAfxLb_Hns9ExyjRvVy

This effect produced a distinct BAO feature in the Reionization 21 cm power spectrum at wave numbers k∼0.1 h/Mpc, near which forthcoming surveys will be most sensitive. In contrast to the highly uncertain impact of streaming velocities on star formation, the effect on clumping can be calculated more precisely because it is set mainly by cosmology and straightforward gas dynamics.  I will discuss the impact of streaming velocities on IGM clumpiness, which we have quantified using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations.  I will also discuss the corresponding impact on the Reionization 21 cm signal.

However, the detection and imaging of 21cm line signal are difficult because the foreground and instrumental systematics are stronger than the expected signal. In order to overcome these obstacles, e propose a new cross correlation approach between observed 21cm-line data and 21cm-line images generated from the distribution of the Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) with the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). We employ the results of our numerical simulations to train the cGAN network so that the network can predict the 21cm-line map from LAE distribution. The cGAN network well reproduces 21cm-line brightness temperature maps and the neutral fraction maps at large scales. Furthermore, we find that the cross correlation is detectable at k<0.2 [1/Mpc] by combing MWA Phase II observation and LAE deep survey of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera.

The redshifted 21-cm signal from this epoch is expected to be highly non-Gaussian in nature due to the involvement of different complex astrophysical processes during this phase e.g. Lyman-alpha coupling, X-ray heating and photoionization. In this work we quantify this evolving non-Gaussianity expected in the signal through the signal bispectrum, while considering a variety of heating and ionizing source models in a suit of radiative transfer simulations of the signal. In this work for the first time we quantify the non-Gaussianity present in this signal by estimating bispectra for all possible unique k-triangles (previous works have considered bispectra for only a few specific k-triangles). Here we also quantify the impact of redshift space distortions, on the signal bispectra, which is an inherent line-of-sight anisotropy present in any observations of this signal. Our investigations show that different heating and ionizing source models affect the signal bispectra differently, based on the stage of the CD and the k-triangles for which the bispectra are being estimated. In case of different source models, even if the mean dT is the same, the sign, shape and amplitude of the bispectrum may differ for a specific k-triangle. Using a quasi-linear model for the 21-cm signal, we show that these differences are due to the different heating and Lyman-alpha coupling topologies in different source models. We find that the impact of the peculiar velocity on the 21-cm CD bispectra is significant, varying in the range ~20% - 200% based on the source model and k-modes for which the bispectra is being estimated. We further observe that the change in amplitude and sign of the bispectra are related to the topology of the redshifted 21-cm signal from this era.",https://youtu.be/x_N1VZCGQQc,,Reionization,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_itTxuSLxpUsHgwVgSvX8adTdzErBZAA
7/5/2020 8:24:04,msc1803121003@iiti.ac.in,Himanshu,Tiwari,"Indian Institute of Technology, Indore",Developing Statistical Inference Tools for the future Observations of CD-EoR ,"The epoch of reionization (EoR) is one of the least known periods in the history of the Universe. The next-generation telescopes (such as SKA, HERA) will be able to directly probe the three dimensional distribution of neutral hydrogen from this era. After that, the aim will be to constrain the astrophysical parameter of EoR accurately, which is mainly done using Bayesian Inference. First generation telescopes try to observe the statistical behaviour of the 21-cm signal. Power spectrum is one of such statistics. However, the 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian in nature. Therefore, 21-cm power-spectrum is insufficient to give the fruit-full information hidden in the non-Gaussian features of the signal, a higher order statistics (i.e. 21-cm Bispectrum) can be a solution to this.
	Until the real signal being observed, EoR simulations are been used to study the EoR, Once we detect the signal, there are a number of theoretical EoR models which can be use to test the future observations, these models are mainly based upon numerical, semi-numerical simulations which take huge amount of time in Bayesian Inference. A promising alternative is to use supervised machine learning (Artificial Neural Networks) based on these models.
	Here we introduce EmuPBk, a python-keras based machine learning package which consists of some already trained artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on the semi-numerical simulation ReionYuga. We have taken a 215 cMpc volume simulation box for generating the matter distribution at redshift z=9.210. These ANNs emulate the 21-cm Powerspectrum and Bispectrum given 3 astrophysical EoR parameters (nion,rmfp,mhalo(min)). These ANNs are trained over 1000 test power spectrum and Bispectrum and further validated over 40 samples and tested over 18 samples.
We have achieved more than 98% and more than 96% accuracy in the predictions of Power spectrum and Bispectrum using these ANNs. 
we attempt to constrain the EoR parameters using sample variance as our covariance matrix for MCMC analysis.
Further, we have simulated SKA-low’s instrumental noise(as used by https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08706) for 1000 realizations, for 1000 and 5000 hours of observation time. The size of the noise-box is the same as used in the simulation. 
As EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian, 21-cm Bispectrum has constrained the EoR parameters more tighter than 21-cm Powespectum.

7/5/2020 15:05:07,anchal.saxena.009@gmail.com,Anchal,Saxena,Indian Institute of Technology Indore,Impact of dark matter models on the EoR 21-cm signal,"The nature of dark matter sets the timeline for the formation of first collapsed halos and thus affects the sources of reionization. Here, we consider two different models of dark matter: cold dark matter (CDM) and thermal warm dark matter (WDM) , and study how they impact the epoch of reionization (EoR) and its 21-cm observables. Using a suite of simulations, we find that in the WDM scenarios, the structure formation on small scales gets suppressed resulting in a smaller number of low mass dark matter halos compared to the CDM scenario. Assuming that the efficiency of sources in producing ionizing photons remain the same, this leads to a lower number of total ionizing photons produced at any given cosmic time and thus in a delay in the reionization process. We also find visual differences in the neutral hydrogen (HI) topology and in 21-cm maps in case of the WDM compared to the CDM. However, differences in the 21-cm power spectra, at the same neutral fraction, are found to be small. Thus, we focus on the non-Gaussianity in the EoR 21-cm signal, quantified through its bispectrum. We find that the 21-cm bispectra (driven by the HI topology) are significantly different in WDM models when compared with CDM, even for same mass averaged neutral fractions. This establishes that the 21-cm bispectrum is a unique and promising way to differentiate between different dark matter models, and can be used to constrain the nature of the dark matter in the future EoR observations.

However, it is still not well-constrained at high redshifts, where most large surveys probe the rest-frame UV. Therefore, they do not directly probe the dust-obscured part of the SFRD density and rely on highly uncertain corrections for dust attenuation. The ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) was designed to measure the dust-obscured SFRD at 4<z<6. It aimed to observe the [CII] line emission and the rest-frame FIR continuum of 118 galaxies laying on the main sequence.
