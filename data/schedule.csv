This allows us to construct composite distribution functions, as well as explore the environmental dependence of galaxy formation and evolution during this critical period of galaxy assembly. The regions are selected from a large parent volume, 3.2 Gpc on a side, based on their overdensity within a sphere of radius 14 h-inverse Mpc, then resimulated with full hydrodynamics. We employ a novel weighting scheme that allows the construction of composite distribution functions that are representative of the full parent volume. I will present initial results from an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), the star formation rate distribution function (SFRF) and the star forming sequence (SFS), analysing the environmental dependence over an unprecedented range of overdensity. The increased dynamic range probed by FLARES will allow us to make predictions for a number of large area surveys that will probe the EoR in coming years, such as WFIRST and Euclid.

Current available periodic boxes like EAGLE or Illustris are ill suited to do this, due to their small volumes and thus relative lack of bright rare galaxies. To overcome this problem we have carried out a suite of zoom simulations targeting a range of overdensities, called the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES). This strategy yields more than an order of magnitude more massive galaxies than EAGLE. With FLARES we are able to probe the role of environment at high-redshift and, for the first time, provide a useful statistical sample of galaxies accessible to Euclid and other upcoming facilities. In this talk I will present the photometric properties of the galaxies in the FLARE simulation project and discuss in particular the role of dust in shaping the bright-end of the luminosity function as well as predictions for nebular line emissions","Reionization, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory",

As rest frame optical wavelengths fall into the near infrared, Spitzer/IRAC fluxes become essential to constrain these properties. I will present results on the star formation rates, stellar masses, and ages of a previously unknown z ~ 8 multiply imaged system behind HFF cluster A370 and ~300 z ~ 6-10 galaxy candidates from the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS) and companion Spitzer-RELICS surveys using photometric redshift fitting using HST and Spitzer fluxes. I will also discuss our spectroscopic follow-up program with Keck. These objects are perfect laboratories for JWST and TMT to study in great detail the stellar properties of galaxies in the early universe.","Reionization, Observations",

Since these galaxies represent the progenitors of present-day galaxies, the galaxy stellar mass function out to z~6-7 is a robust and crucial tool to study the build-up of stellar mass in the Universe and provides the tightest constraints on cosmological simulations. These high-redshift galaxies are very faint and thus particularly hard to observe in blank fields. Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters allows to probe z~6-7 galaxies down to 10⁶ solar masses, providing valuable constraints on the very low-mass end of the mass function. Until the JWST comes online however these galaxies can only be observed in a few broad-band HST and Spitzer/IRAC filters, making the derivation of their stellar mass particularly difficult, i.e. requiring assumptions on parameters such as star-forming history, stellar age, dust content, metallicity, etc.
In my presentation I will present our recent work on the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function at z=6-7 using the gravitational magnification of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters. I will discuss these results regarding strong lensing and SED-fitting uncertainties in order to assess what is believable in the resulting mass function regarding these uncertainties.","Reionization, Star formation histories, Observations",

One scenario allows reionization to start late and complete rapidly, where moderately luminous galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget (Robertson et al. 2015). Another scenario allows a smooth temporal evolution of reionization, where very faint galaxies, common at early times, dominate the photon budget (Finkelstein et al. 2019). These models differ drastically in their predictions for the ionized fraction at z~9 (~20% vs. ~60%), and our recent MOSFIRE program has sought Lyα emission at this epoch to distinguish between these two possibilities. We have implemented improved data reduction and stacking of spectra, which accounts for the drift of objects in the slits throughout the night, and unknown offsets of our objects from the expected location in the slit. In this talk, I will show our tentative Lyα detection (5σ) at z=8.661 in the EGS field in 9.53 hours of integration. This galaxy lies physically close (3.5 pMpc) to another confirmed galaxy in this field, with Lyα detected at z=8.684 (Zitrin et al. 2015). This nearby galaxy also has a tenuous NV emission line (Mainali et al. 2018) indicating the presence of an AGN. Our source might suggest the presence of the highest redshift overdensity in the reionization era, indicate the existence of ≥1Mpc ionized bubbles as early as 500Myr after the Big Bang, and shed light on galaxy growth in the early universe.","Reionization, Observations",

Our main results include distribution functions for rest-frame UV luminosity, M*, and SFR, which we show agree extremely well with a variety of available observational constraints across the redshift range z = 4 - 10. With our extremely efficient framework, we can simultaneously sample galaxies over an extremely wide mass range, including the faint, low-mass ones that form in halos near the atomic cooling limit, and also the rarest, most massive objects forming at these epochs. We also explore how current uncertainties from observations may affect the predictions of theoretical models, where model components are very sensitive to the observations calibrated to, such as SF efficiency and feedback.","Reionization, Dark ages, Theory",

To this end, surveys of redshift z>9 galaxies have revealed several sources for which especially red Spitzer/IRAC colours unambiguously reveal the presence of a significant rest-frame 4000 A Balmer break, indicative of mature stellar populations which can greatly aid in constraining the timing of Cosmic Dawn. However, at lower redshifts of z~7-9 the cause of such red Spitzer/IRAC colours is not so clear cut, given degeneracies caused by the contamination of the filters by strong (EW>1000 A) [OIII]5007 A + Hbeta nebular emission lines indicative of gas excited by young stellar populations. Thus, distinguishing between the two scenarios is a prerequisite towards determining the prevalence of Balmer break objects at z>7 and, for the brightest sources, placing tighter constraints on a potential steepening of the cosmic SFR density at z>8 indicative of younger galaxy ages. To address this, we select and perform detailed SED fitting of the brightest (MUV~-21.5 AB), spectroscopically-confirmed sources at z>~7-9, which display especially red Spitzer/IRAC colours and for which ALMA [OIII] 88 micron data is available. We explore whether the inclusion of the ALMA data, and in particular the [OIII] 88 micron emission line, can break the colour degeneracy and reveal the Balmer break contributions to the NIR photometry for our sources. Our modelling finds the photometry of half our sample of 4 z>7 galaxies are dominated by Balmer break contributions and stellar ages >100 Myrs, while the rest can be explained with strong nebular emission lines and stellar ages <10 Myr. We discuss the implications of our results on the cosmic accretion rate of the brightest galaxies and further demonstrate how the arrival of new facilities such as JWST will settle the debate with only a few hours of observations with e.g., NIRCam and/or NIRSpec.","Reionization, Star formation histories, Metal/dust enrichment, Observations",

Our knowledge of galaxies during this epoch is still in its infancy, but what little we know hints that these galaxies emit copious UV radiation, powered by massive stars with low metal content and significant ionization. While the Lyman-alpha line is the UV gold standard for finding galaxies during this epoch, the resonant line is highly sensitive to neutral Hydrogen -- often pushing the redshift derived from this line hundreds of km/s redwards of the true redshift. However, the rest-UV spectra of galaxies contain a rich variety of nebular metal emission lines which can trace the systemic redshift of these distant sources, and contain highly valuable information about the massive stars and physical conditions in galaxies during this epoch. Such UV nebular lines are targetable at these redshifts, yet have been unexplored except in rare, individual cases. I will discuss an ongoing spectroscopic search for rest-UV nebular metal lines in reionization-era galaxies in the CANDELS fields, including a detailed analysis of a CIII]1907,1909 detection at z=7.5032, and show preliminary results from the broader NIR spectroscopic program currently ongoing.","Reionization, Observations",

However, although the history of cosmic star-formation has been thoroughly mapped at UV/optical wavelengths out to z~11, FIR/submm surveys have not kept apace. Consequently, the total amount of star formation that is absorbed and re-emitted by dust at high redshifts remains highly uncertain. During this talk, we will introduce the Mapping Obscuration to Reionization ALMA (MORA) Survey, the first interferometric blind map at 2mm covering ~180 sq. arcmin.  By combining our new 2mm number counts with the state-of-the-art galaxy number counts at other wavelengths, we put the first observational constraints on the dust-obscured star formation up to z~8, completing the picture of the shape of the cosmic star formation rate density out the earliest epochs. 
Does the dust-obscured star formation dominate during the early Universe? Our best answer to this question will be presented.","Star formation histories, Metal/dust enrichment, Observations",

probe the late stages of cosmic reionization. The observed sudden drop
in Ly$\alpha$ fraction at $z>6$ is often interpreted as a sign of
reionization, since the IGM is more neutral and opaque, which reduces
Ly$\alpha$ photon transmission. Crucially, this interpretation of the
observations is only valid under the assumption that galaxies
themselves experience a minimal evolution at these epochs. By
modelling Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects in and around
galaxies, we examine whether a change in the galactic properties can
reproduce the observed drop in the Ly$\alpha$ fraction. We find that
an increase in the galactic neutral hydrogen content or a reduction in
the outflow velocity toward higher redshift both lead to a lower
Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and can thus mimic an increasing neutral
fraction. We furthermore find, however, that this change in galactic
properties leads to systematically different Lya spectra which can be
used to differentiate the two competing effects. Our results caution
the use of Ly$\alpha$ observations to estimate IGM neutral fraction,
without accounting for the potential change in the galactic properties,
e.g., by mapping out the evolution of Ly$\alpha$ spectral characteristics.","Reionization, First stars, AGN, Star formation histories, Theory, Observations","I might likely change my talk later, I am currently working on another project to explore how galaxies can mimic reionization by reproducing the drop in Lya fraction. This might be more interesting and also very helpful to me to hear the comments from the great Lya community who are attending. I will confirm this in a few weeks before the workshop. thanks."

MRS is the only instrument onboard JWST able to detect the Halpha and Hbeta+[0III] emission lines on sources beyond 6.7 and 9, respectively. In this talk, I will summarize the spectroscopic MIRI high-z GTO program and present realistic deep (10 to 40 ksec) MRS simulated spectra of recently (ALMA) spectroscopically-confirmed EoR sources at redshifts above 7. The simulations make use of the MIRI instrument simulator (MIRISim), JWST calibration pipeline, and spectral templates assuming emission line ratios typical of low-metallicity (~0.2 solar) and metal-poor (~0.04-0.02 solar) galaxies.","Reionization, Observations, Tools",

But while ALMA can characterize individual, bright objects in great detail, understanding emission on large scales and from fainter galaxies will require specialized instruments with much more sensitivity. I will present SuperSpec, a novel wideband mm-wave spectrometer that performs the spectroscopy entirely on a silicon wafer, reducing detector volume by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art grating spectrometers. I will discuss our first deployment to the Large Millimeter Telescope this year, where we will demonstrate a 6-spectrometer instrument sensitive to 200-300 GHz at R~275.

Our current understanding of star-formation at high redshifts (z > 7) is mostly formed through rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). This directly probes stellar light and ionized hydrogen, however fails to properly account for any dust-obscured star-formation. 

I will discuss the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations on UV-selected high-redshift galaxies in sub-mm colours through continuum and spectral lines (e.g. [OIII] and [CII]). In particular, I will focus on one such galaxy, MACS0416_Y1, where an ALMA detection of [OIII] confirmed its spectroscopic redshift to be z = 8.312. Modelling of its UV-to-FIR spectrum suggests both a young (age ~ 4 Myr) and old stellar component (z ~ 14) in a moderately high metallicity LBG (Z ~ 0.2 Zsun). 

Evidence points towards an actively star-forming system, with indications of the onset of star-formation feedback through supernovae. For example, the [CII] velocity profile suggests either a rotation-dominated system, or strong outflows that can rapidly quench star-formation within the galaxy, in line with recent hydrodynamic models. I will also discuss how its high dust temperature (Tdust > 80K) is able to trace the phase and timescale of dust creation using recent dust and galaxy evolution models.","Reionization, Star formation histories, Metal/dust enrichment, Observations","Dear organizers, I would just like to take this opportunity to thank you for your apt (in my opinion) response to the current crises (both of them...).

Spatially resolved observations of these galaxies with existing telescopes already allow us to probe the emission from young stars, the interstellar medium and the properties of surrounding hydrogen gas. In this talk specifically, I will focus on spectroscopic follow-up studies of luminous galaxies at z>6 with ALMA, HST/WFC3, and MUSE and X-SHOOTER on the VLT. We find that these galaxies likely reside in early ionised bubbles and are complex systems, consisting of multiple components where traces of metals and outflows are already present.

We make use of the deep Keck/DEIMOS spectra and the ALMA [CII]158 um emission lines of the galaxies at z=5-6 available to date, to obtain metal absorption lines and the precise systemic velocities, respectively. We fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption lines in a composite Keck spectrum. The measured maximum outflow velocity at z~5-6 is vmax = 700^{+180}_{-110} km/s on average, which is higher than those at z=0 by a factor of 3 and comparable to z=2, at M*~10^{10.1} Mo. Interestingly, vmax shows a clear positive correlation with SFR and vcir, the halo circular velocity estimated from the stellar masses, for galaxies with M*=10^{10.0-10.8} Mo at z=0-6 with ~0.1 dex scatters. This positive correlation with vcir is in good agreement with theoretical predictions and suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related to the halo circular velocity. The redshift evolution of vmax at M*~10^{10.1} Mo is explained by the increase of vcir toward high redshift.","Reionization, Star formation histories, Observations",

At early times, galaxy formation proceeded at an accelerating rate, and the star formation activity largely contributed to the reionization of the Universe. However, as the UV emission is preferably absorbed and scattered by dust grains, understanding the dust attenuation properties and dust obscured star formation activity is essential for a complete picture of the early Universe. In this talk, we present our recent studies on the dust attenuation properties of star forming galaxies at z~5 using the UV spectral slope (β) and InfRared eXcess (IRX=L_IR/L_UV) i.e. IRX-β relation, based on the recent ALMA large program ALPINE. We found a lower IRX at fixed β compared to the locally calibrated relations, indicating a rapid evolution of dust attenuation properties at z>5. Similarly, we found galaxies at z~5 have lower IRX values up to 1 dex on average at fixed mass compared to previously studied IRX-M* relations at z<4. This implies a lower obscured fraction of star-formation than at lower redshifts. Nevertheless, massive, UV-selected galaxies at z~5−6 already exhibit an obscured fraction of star formation of ~45%, suggesting a rapid build-up of dust during the epoch of reionization.","Metal/dust enrichment, Observations",

The abundance of molecular gas during the era of peak star formation will be probed meanwhile by the rotational CO lines emitted by galaxies at lower redshifts. On behalf of the collaboration, I will first provide an overview of TIME and its current development status. The constraining power of TIME on a number of observables, including the [C II] power spectrum and the line luminosity function will then be discussed.

We clearly detect [OIII] and [CII] lines from all of the galaxies at 4.3-11.8sigma levels, and identify multi-band dust continuum emission in two of the three galaxies, allowing us to estimate infrared luminosities and dust temperatures simultaneously. In conjunction with previous ALMA observations for six galaxies at z>6, we confirm that all the nine z=6-9 galaxies have high [OIII]/[CII] ratios of L[OIII]/L[CII]~3-20, ~10 times higher than z~0 galaxies. We also find a positive correlation between the [OIII]/[CII] ratio and the Lya equivalent width (EW) at the ~90% confidence level. We carefully investigate physical origins of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios at z=6-9 using Cloudy, and find that high density of the interstellar medium, low C/O abundance ratio, and the cosmic microwave background attenuation are responsible to only a part of the z=6-9 galaxies. Instead, the observed high [OIII]/[CII] ratios are explained by 10-100 times higher ionization parameters or low photodissociation region (PDR) covering fractions of 0-10%. The latter scenario can be reproduced with a density bounded nebula with PDR deficit, which would enhance the Lya, Lyman continuum, and C+ ionizing photons escape from galaxies, consistent with the [OIII]/[CII]-Lya EW correlation we find.","Reionization, Metal/dust enrichment, Observations",

In particular, this sample has metallicities measured using the ""direct"" electron temperature method through the detection of the auroral emission lines [OIII]4363 or OIII]1663, allowing for a robust determination of metallicity.  I use this sample to investigate the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation and strong-line metallicity calibrations with redshift, providing guidance for how to derive abundances from JWST emission-line measurements of EoR galaxies.  Leveraging unique direct-method constraints on the nebular metallicity, I utilize photoionization modeling to constrain the ionization parameters and ionizing source properties of these galaxies, finding that very hard ionizing spectra are required, likely a result of alpha-enhanced massive stars due to short galaxy formation timescales.  Even with JWST, it will not be feasible to obtain deep enough rest-optical and rest-UV spectra to detect these auroral lines in typical EoR sources.  I will introduce an alternative method for obtaining direct-method metallicities at z>6 that leverages synergy between ALMA and JWST spectroscopy, and discuss initial results on galaxy metallicities at z~8 from a pilot study and implications for the star-formation histories of these galaxies.","Analogues, Reionization, Star formation histories, Metal/dust enrichment, Observations",

In this talk, I will present initial results on a sample of galaxies selected to have low stellar masses (~10^8 M⊙) and J125-band flux excesses indicative of intense [O III] + Hβ emission (EW[OIII]+Hβ =500–2000 Å), similar to what has been observed at z > 6. We detect C III] emissions with EW reaching values seen in the reionization era (EWCIII]≃17−22 Å) in two sources with the strongest optical line emission (EW[OIII]+Hβ≃2000 Å). We have obtained near-infrared spectrum of the strongest C III] emitter in our sample, revealing gas that is both metal poor and highly ionized. Using photoionization models, we are able to simultaneously reproduce the intense C III] and optical line emission for extremely young (2–3 Myr) and metal-poor (0.06–0.08 Z⊙) stellar populations, as would be expected after a substantial upturn in the star formation rate of a low-mass galaxy. The sources in this survey are among the first for which C III] has been used as the primary means of redshift confirmation. We suggest that it should be possible to extend this approach to z > 6 with current facilities, using C III] to measure redshifts of objects with IRAC excesses indicating EW[OIII]+Hβ≃2000, providing a method of spectroscopic confirmation independent of Lyα.",Analogues,

Rest-frame UV spectroscopy of galaxies at z > 6 has revealed peculiar spectral properties. Detections of intense CIII] and CIV line emission (EW > 15 - 20 A) in z > 6 systems indicate a hard ionizing spectrum that is not seen in typical star forming galaxies at lower redshifts, while its origin remains a matter of debate. Luminous galaxies with extremely large [OIII]+H-beta EW (> 1000 A) at z > 7 have been shown to have much stronger Lyman-alpha emission than the general population at z > 7. This result has proved puzzling given the strong attenuation expected from the partially neutral IGM at z ~ 7 - 9. To interpret the emerging results at z > 6, a comprehensive investigation of the spectral properties of reionization-era analogs is required. I have conducted a near-infrared spectroscopic survey targeting rest-frame optical emission lines in 250 extreme [OIII] emitters at z ~ 1 - 3 where they can be studied in much greater detail. These systems show low stellar masses and large specific star formation rates that are similar to galaxies in the reionization-era. I have recently followed it up with a large Magellan and MMT spectroscopic survey targeting rest-frame UV metal lines (CIII], OIII], CIV) and Lyman-alpha emission lines. I will present the latest results from this survey. I find that the CIII] EW increases with [OIII]+H-beta EW, but I also find a large dispersion in CIII] EW at the largest [OIII]+H-beta EW. I will comment on how gas-phase metallicity may impact the CIII] EW variation, and discuss the implications for the intense CIII] emission seen at z > 6. Finally, I will show that strong Lyman-alpha emission (EW > 25 A) becomes more common in galaxies with larger [OIII]+H-beta EW, and discuss the implications for the Lyman-alpha visibility at z > 7.","Reionization, Observations",

We measured star-formation intensity (SFI; star formation rate per unit area) from the central 250 pc region (S250pc) using Cosmic Origins Spectrograph near-ultraviolet images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that while the Lyα equivalent width (EW(Lyα)) and the Lyα escape fraction are not significantly correlated with the central SFI (S250pc), both are positively correlated with the ratio of surface brightness to galaxy stellar mass (S250pc/Mstar), with correlation coefficients (p-values) of 0.702 (1×10-8)and 0.529 (5×10-4) with EW(Lyα) and the Lyα escape fraction, respectively. These correlations suggest a scenario where intense central star formation can drive a galactic wind in galaxies with relatively shallow gravitational potential wells, thus clearing channels for the escape of Lyα photons.","Analogues, Reionization, Escape fractions, Observations",

Constraining the neutral gas properties of local analogues of the first galaxies provides valuable insights to understand how ionizing photons escape star-forming galaxies and explain the astrophysics required to reionize the Universe. We recently investigated the connection between the ISM porosity (characterized by the H I covering fraction), the Lyman alpha properties and the escape of LyC photons in a sample of 22 star-forming galaxies, including 12 confirmed LyC leakers. We found that the presence of low-density channels shapes the Lyman alpha profile, is the origin of the strong Lyman alpha emission, and enables the escape of ionizing photons in low-z leakers. Hence, the porosity of the ISM is a crucial property to understand the leakage of Lyman alpha and LyC photons. I will additionally discuss how the Lyman alpha properties and the low-ionization metal absorption lines, such as Si II, can indirectly probe the neutral gas properties in high-z galaxies and estimate the escape of ionizing photons.

Recent upper limits on Epoch of Reionization structure from the Murchison Widefield Array have entered a new regime of upper limit phase-space. A combination of innovative analysis techniques and delicate RFI avoidance have contributed to a significant improvement of almost a factor of 10. The challenges in detection that we yet face are rather unique from other studies in this time period of the Universe: extreme data volumes, spectral precision requirements, and advanced Fourier analysis.

In this work, we present the updated results of our z ~ 5 quasar survey using the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), a near-infrared imaging survey covering an area of 85 deg^2. From our spectroscopic observations with the GMOS on the Gemini-South 8 m Telescope, we discovered eight new quasars at z ~ 5 with -26.1 < M1450 < -23.3. Combining our IMS faint quasars (M1450 > -27 mag) with the brighter SDSS quasars (M1450 < -27 mag), we derive, for the first time, the z ~ 5 quasar luminosity function (QLF) without any fixed parameters down to the magnitude limit of M1450 = -23 mag. We find that the faint-end slope of the QLF is very flat (alpha = -1.3), with a characteristic luminosity of M1450* = -25.8 mag. The number density of z ~ 5 quasars from the QLF gives lower ionizing emissivity at 912 A and ionizing photon density than previous studies, and they discredit the idea that quasars alone could have ionized the IGM.","Reionization, AGN, Observations",

Complemented with previous [CII] 158um and [OIII] 88um observations, ratios between line emissions from the ionized and neutral gas are used to probe the ISM properties. Comparisons with molecular line observations of local (U)LIRGs, AGNs, and high redshift SMGs suggest that J2310+1855 (i) exhibits higher CO excitation for J ≥ 8; (ii) reveals higher H2O/IR, H2O/CO and OH+ /H2O ratios. These suggest that mechanisms besides UV radiation (e.g., shocks, cosmic rays or X-rays) are responsible for the molecular gas heating and ionization. As for the line emissions from the ionized and atomic ISM, J2310+1855 shows a comparable [OIII] 88um/[NII] 122um ratio with local systems, which suggests a metallicity of Z/Z⊙=1.5−2.1. The low [CII] 158um/[OI] 146um ratio (comparable to the lowest values found in local (U)LIRGs), in addition to a [OI] 146um /FIR ratio >2× that expected from the local relation, indicates no [OI] 146um deficit, revealing warm and dense gas possibly heated by the AGN.

Until now, only rough scalings of the kSZ amplitude with reionisation duration or midpoint were used. Our approach is based on a novel and extremely simple description of the power spectrum of the free electrons density contrast, however sufficient to describe the physics at stake, as confirmed when applying it to a wide range of simulations.

The effective radius r_e,[CII] exceeds r_e,UV by factors of ~2-3 and the ratio of r_e,[CII]/r_e,UV increases as a function of M_star. We do not find strong evidence that [CII] line, the rest-frame UV, and FIR continuum are always displaced over ~ 1-kpc scale from each other. We identify 30% of isolated ALPINE sources as having an extended [CII] component over 10-kpc scales detected at 4.1σ-10.9σ beyond the size of rest-frame UV and far-infrared (FIR) continuum. One object has tentative rotating features up to ~10-kpc, where the 3D model fit shows the rotating [CII]-gas disk spread over 4 times larger than the rest-frame UV-emitting region.

Observing how the gas inside galaxies moves reveals a wealth of information, including the presence of inflows and outflows, minor and major mergers, and underlying rotation. However, the sample of galaxy observations at z>4 that featured the sensitivity and resolution for rotational analysis or resolved dynamical characterization has been small.

These measurements and their interpretation are still strongly debated. In this talk, I will present new results combining deep HST and MUSE data. We use the Hubble Ultra Deep Field catalog from Rafelski et al.

We measure Lya emission with the deep IFU data from the MUSE HUDF survey homogeneously over the wide redshift range (e.g., Bacon et al. 2017). We find low values of the LAE fraction ~10-20% and confirm a moderate increase as a function of redshift from z~3 to 6, for galaxies brighter than MUV = -17.75 AB. We do not find a significant dependence of the LAE fraction on UV magnitude from -22 to -18 mag at z~3-4, and our value is lower than those in the literature at faint UV magnitude. The difference can be explained by an LBG selection bias which we discuss quantitatively. Comparing our results with a galaxy evolution model (Garel et al. 2015), we find that the cosmic variance does not affect our results. Our results suggest either a lower increase of the LAE fraction towards z~6 than previously suggested, or even a turnover of the LAE fraction at z~5.5 which may be the signature of a late or patchy reionization process.

So it is imperative to build a model to accurately predict LyC emission using the observable properties of galaxies in the reionization era. In recent years, studies have shown that the Lya emission  from galaxies may be correlated to LyC emission. In this study we have studied this correlation by analyzing thousands of galaxies in the cosmological radiation - hydrodynamical simulation SPHINX. We have post-processed these galaxies with Lya radiative transfer code RASCAS, taking into account both recombination and collision as sources of Lya. We have found that around z = 6, there is a strong correlation between both output and input Lya and LyC luminosities of galaxies. There is also a positive correlation between Lya and LyC escape fractions in the brightest Lya emitters as found in observational studies, but when we include the entire population of galaxies, combining fainter LAEs with the brighter ones, the correlation is not significant. The same pattern is found in galaxies at higher redshifts too. In the next step, we have built a model using multiple linear regression method and have shown that given the physical properties and the Lya luminosity and escape fraction, we can predict its output LyC luminosity and LyC escape fraction with a high degree of accuracy. This is a significant result that can help us identify the reionization sources and can be especially useful in the forthcoming observational surveys, such as the early-universe survey by JWST.","Reionization, Escape fractions, Theory",

One possibility is that the most opaque regions at these redshifts contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen. This explanation, which abandons the common assumption that reionization ended before z = 6. Here we explore a model in which the neutral fraction is still ≈ 10% at z = 5.5. We confirm that this model can account for the observed scatter in Lyα forest opacities, as well as the observed Lyβ transmission in the J0148 trough. We contrast the model with a competing “earlier” reionization scenario characterized by a short mean free path and large fluctuations in the post-reionization ionizing background. We consider Lyα and Lyβ effective optical depths, their correlations, trough size distributions, dark pixel fractions, the IGM thermal history, and spatial distributions of Lyman-α emitters around forest sight lines. We find that the models are broadly similar in almost all of these statistics, suggesting that it may be difficult to distinguish between them definitively. We argue that improved constraints on the mean free path and the thermal history at z > 5 could go a long way towards diagnosing the origin of the z > 5.5 opacity fluctuations.","Reionization, Theory",

Due to the high opacity of the IGM during this epoch, studying this period is difficult, yet it could reveal much about the traits of early galaxies. In this work, we demonstrate that reionization may also be studied through analysis of metal line absorption systems such as those seen in quasar spectra, arising from enriched gas in the CGM and IGM, complementary to methods focused solely on neutral hydrogen. To accomplish this, we use cosmological simulations of the EoR, including on-the-fly multi-frequency radiative transfer, using the Technicolor Dawn code. Through generation of mock quasar sightlines and simulated spectra, we analyze metrics of metal absorption and other gas parameters to reveal their connection to the process of reionization. Additionally, by incorporating several stellar population synthesis models, including one with binary stars, we examine how differing stellar emissivities impact the timing of reionization and the preferred ionization states of metals in the enriched CGM and IGM. We find that the ionization states of common absorbing transitions are sensitive to the amplitude and spectral shape of the ionizing background, suggesting that careful observations of these systems will place constraints on the nature of the primary contributors to reionization, particularly whether quasars could have played a major part. Further, we determine the redshift evolution of metals is dependent on the ionizing background and, through abundance ratios of neutral oxygen and silicon, can be directly tied to the neutral fraction of hydrogen, assisting in studies of the timing of reionization. Finally, we show that while the harder spectra of binary stars can affect elemental ionization states and lead to an accelerated reionization history, it can also lead to decreased star formation rate density through gas heating, and subsequently altered levels of enrichment in gas and stars. This work reveals a complex interplay between several simulation parameters, and also highlights the usefulness of metal line studies at z>5.","Reionization, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory",

Here we present work using both photometric and spectroscopic Lya observations to develop techniques that can be used to put constraints on the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In a recent paper we demonstrated that multivariate analysis applied to non-Lya quantities can be used to predict the Lya output of a sample of local starforming galaxies to unprecendented accuracy both when considering absolute luminosity and equivalent width. With JWST it will be possible to measure the required quantities at very high redshift, enabling us to apply this relation to galaxies in the EoR. When combined with observerations of the targets actual Lya output this would allow the estimation of the approximate IGM transmission to a given galaxy and potentially determinations of IGM opacity on a sightline-to-sightline basis. Using resolved information from Lya spectroscopy can also help constrain IGM transmission and the progress of the EoR. Using Lya emitters in the MUSE Wide survey and stacking analysis we have been able to trace the evolution of emission on the blue side of Lya as a function of redshift and by comparing to IGM simulations and low redshift galaxies we have shown this to be consistent with pure IGM evolution.","Analogues, Reionization, Escape fractions, Observations",

The VPF is sensitive to voids and can be easily compared for samples of the same number density, and therefore might be the best option for teasing out the particular clustering caused by 'inside-out' patchy reionization.

It has been argued that in order to rapidly grow these SMBHs in such short amounts of cosmic time, they need to accrete matter over timescales comparable to the age of the universe, and thus the lifetime of quasars - the integrated time that galaxies shine as active quasars - is expected to be of order ~10^9 yr at z~6, even if they accrete continuously at the Eddington limit. 
I will present a new method to obtain model-independent constraints on the lifetime of high-redshift quasars with unprecedented precision, based on measurements of the sizes of ionized regions around quasars, known as proximity zones. The sizes of these proximity zones are sensitive to the lifetime of the quasars, because the intergalactic gas has a finite response time to the quasars’ radiation.

The main contributors to the ionizing ultraviolet (UV) flux during reionization are likely to be young star-forming galaxies, as active galactic nuclei alone appear to be insufficient. Neutral gas along the line of sight to distant galaxies acts as an opaque veil to this ionizing radiation, preventing us from measuring it directly at z>~5. Therefore, identifying galaxies as close to this redshift as possible that exhibit escaping ionizing flux, observed as continuum below the Lyman break at λ < 912 A, is imperative to understanding cosmic reionization. We present a sample of high-redshift (z=3-5) Lyman continuum (LyC) galaxies (LCGs). This elusive population has previously been overlooked in most searches for high-redshift star-forming galaxies, typically selected with the classic Lyman break technique, due to the non-zero flux where a break is expected. We are developing a novel and less biased selection method for finding individual high-redshift LCGs that is proving to be an effective way to identify this rare population. We present the results from our successful pilot study to search for LCGs in the COSMOS field.

Faint star-forming galaxies are leading candidates because they are found to be numerous and may have significant ionizing photon escape fractions (fesc). In this talk I will update this picture via an empirical model that successfully predicts latest observations (e.g., the rapid drop in star-formation density (ρSFR at z > 8). We generate an ionizing spectrum for each galaxy in our model and constrain fesc by leveraging latest measurements of the reionization timeline (e.g., Lyα damping of quasars and galaxies at z > 7). We find MUV < -13.5 galaxies need an average fesc of 0.2 to complete reionization. The inferred IGM neutral fraction is [0.9, 0.5, 0.1] at z=[8.2,6.8,6.2] ± 0.2 - that is, the bulk of reionization transpires rapidly in 300 Myr, driven by the z > 8 ρSFR and favored by high neutral fractions (∼60%-90%) measured at z ∼ 7-8. We propose a physically motivated model relating fesc to ΣSFR and find fesc scales as ΣSFR^{0.4±0.1}. Since ΣSFR falls by ∼2.5 dex between z = 8 and z = 0, our model explains the humble upper limits on fesc at lower redshifts and its required evolution to fesc ∼ 0.2 at z > 6. Within this model, strikingly, <5% of galaxies with MUV <-18 and log(M⋆/M☉) >8 (the ""oligarchs"") account for >80% of the reionization budget - a stark departure from the canonical ""democratic"" reionization led by copious faint sources. In fact, faint sources (MUV > -16) must be relegated to a limited role in order to ensure high neutral fractions at z = 7-8. Shallow faint-end slopes of the UV luminosity function (α>-2) and/or fesc distributions skewed toward massive galaxies produce the required late and rapid reionization.

For each star, we follow the mass and metallicity dependent yields of 10 individual metal species (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Sr, and Ba) along with individual fields tracking independently enrichment from each of the above nucleosynthetic sources. These simulations also include a model for Type Ia enrichment from 4 different potential progenitors and a separate r-process enrichment channel. These simulations are currently running, and I will focus on the motivation and methods behind them and plans for exciting science to be done in the near future.
