Thanks in part to its unique position above the Earth's atmosphere and five manned servicing missions it has maintained its position as one of the world’s premier observatories to this day. Over its 30 year career Hubble has had an unprecedented scientific and cultural impact; discoveries extending from the outer Solar System to the edge of the observable Universe have revolutionised our understanding of astronomy and cosmology while its spectacular images have inspired the wider public’s wonder.,https://youtu.be/8S-Y9yjm1zM,,Outreach and diversity,,No (included),

This unconventional result originated from carefully tracking the small-scale structure to below jean mass prior to reionization with high-resolution simulations. As a result, one is able to track the HEMD (High-Entropy, Mean-Density) gas in mini-voids, which takes cosmological timescales to relax into the usual-temperature density relation of the IGM. Here, I will show how the memory of  inhomogeneous reionization in the Lya forest power spectra — currently a broadband systematic effect for the Lya forest community- could potentially become a window into the Epoch of Reionization.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozkUkRAPvHY,,"Reionization, Theory",,No (included),

The first generation of stars were born a few hundred million years after the big bang. These stars synthesise elements heavier than H and He, which are later expelled into the interstellar medium, initiating the rise of metals. Within this enriched medium, the first dust grains were formed. This event is cosmologically crucial for molecule formation, as dust plays a major role by cooling low-metallicity star-forming clouds, which can fragment to create lower mass stars. Collecting information on these first dust grains is difficult because of the negative alliance of large distances and low dust masses.
Aims: We aim to combine the observational information from galaxies at redshifts 5 ≲ z ≲ 10 to constrain their dust emission and theoretically understand the first evolutionary phases of the dust cycle.
Methods: Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are fitted with CIGALE and the physical parameters and their evolution are modelled. From this SED fitting, we built a dust-emission template for this population of galaxies in the reionisation epoch.
Results: Our new models explain why some early galaxies are observed and others are not. We follow in time the formation of the first grains by supernovae later destroyed by other supernova blasts and expelled in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media.
Conclusions: We find evidence for the first dust grains formed in the universe. But above all, this work underlines the need to collect more data and to develop new facilities to further constrain the dust cycle in galaxies in the reionisation epoch.",https://youtu.be/eFJK2xrfbWg,,"First stars, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory, Observations",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a2FdmO3UOc6SgCeOikTb6qUqNoumPXUa,Yes,

Here I present analysis of near-infrared HST imaging of six z=6 quasars, where a point source subtraction technique has been applied to obtain upper limits on the UV emission from their host galaxies. We also find nearby galaxies around five of these six quasars, suggesting that the quasars may be in high-density environments with ongoing merger activity. I will detail our plans to make follow-up observations of these quasars with our guaranteed-time on JWST, and explain how applying our analysis technique to JWST images should lead to the first near-infrared detections of z=6 quasar hosts.",https://youtu.be/nZOyZl86-UM,,"AGN, Observations",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FH11cyhpPrnNCfHChRJ3w23gU3aY2GUo,No (included),

Since the intergalactic medium was opaque to lyman continuum radiation during reionization, it will never be possible to observe directly the escape fraction, so we have to rely on indirect measurements. 
One potential method for an indirect measurement uses the absorption lines from low-ionization states of metal, like SiII 1260A, CII 1334A etc.  Those ions are good tracers of neutral hydrogen, and so the covering fraction measured from these absorption lines are thought to correlate well with the HI covering fraction. And, in turn, if the covering fraction of HI is less than unity, there are some low density channels in the ISM in which the ionizing photons can espace.
Our aim is to compute mock spectra of these absorption lines from simulated galaxies and correlate their spectral characteristics with the escape fraction of LyC radiation along that line of sight.

For this work I use a very high resolution Ramses-RT zoom simulation at redshift 3. I compute the density of several absorbers in all the cells with KROME, I use RASCAS to scatter the stellar light through the interstellar medium of these galaxies (since all the LIS lines considered are resonant lines with or without fluorescent re-emission). Finally, I build mock spectra in chosen directions of observation using the peeling-off technics, and measure several observables such as equivalent widths — in absorption and in emission through fluorescent channels—, the residual flux or velocities (Vmin at the maximum of absorption, Vmax the maximum velocity at which there is absorption).

I will present results on the correlations between these mock observables and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation. I will also highlight the fact that many properties of a galaxy, like escape fraction and absorption line shape, depend highly on the orientation of the galaxy. Finally, I will show the important role of dust, scattering effects and gas velocity in the formation of the absorption lines.",https://youtu.be/HrIBarmbWzI,,Escape fractions,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jLoNfliYLfpH6ED_9oNKI17W6_hkhKLW,No (included),

Our understanding of reionization and galaxy evolution relies upon knowledge of the stellar populations and gas conditions in these early galaxies. In recent years Spitzer IRAC observations have revealed strong rest-optical emission in z>6 galaxies with [OIII]+Hbeta equivalent widths in excess of 800-1000A.  Such strong emission has also been seen in the spectra of ""Green Peas"" at z~0 and some star forming galaxies at z~2 where it is associated with elevated ionising photon production efficiencies and signifies upturns and bursts in star formation.  These conditions are thought to be conducive to larger escape fractions and hence these systems are more efficient ionising agents. Through modeling the [OIII] equivalent width distribution of the full population of z~2 star forming galaxies, we identify the highest-EW tail of the population, showing that these ideal ionisers are effectively absent in the general z~2 population. We present evidence for their redshift evolution towards Reionization, characterised by the increasing abundance of these ""extreme emission line galaxies"" and report their important role within this era.",https://youtu.be/LPCWmga8eUc,,"Analogues, Escape fractions",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wc7qoyA--NmXlmN4lGpPWQEurzBpWIS9,No (included),

How do their interstellar medium (ISM) properties influence the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation? Answers to these questions hold the key to understand galaxy evolution.

In this talk I will present a novel method to simultaneously characterise the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the ISM properties of galaxies in the EoR through the combination of [CII] 158 μm and C III] λ1909 emission line data. The method allows us to determine the target galaxy average density, the gas metallicity, and 'burstiness' parameter, quantifying deviations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.

Spitzer confirmation is no longer possible and [3.6]-[4.5] color depends strongly on nebular emission. With only a few photometry data points are available, it becomes attractive to add criteria based on their morphology in these J- and H-band images. One could do so through visual inspection, a size criterion, or alternate morphometrics.
 
I explore a BoRG z~9-10 candidate galaxies and the object rejected
 by Morishita+ (2018) to explore the utility of a size criterion in z=9-10 candidate selection. Size and Gini-Asymmetry morphometrics all show promise as priors for the searches for high redshift sources in wide and shallow near-infrared space based imaging (e.g. Hubble, Euclid and Roman Space Telescopes). Size, morphometric and photometry combined form the data on which machine learning can identify high- redshift candidates instead of a visual inspection.

By running radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of reionization, I show that the suppression of the faint-end slope of the UV LF due to photoheating feedback of reionization is likely not detectable, owing to the sub-dominant role of photoheating feedback in regulating star formation compared to supernova feedback (1903.06167).  By generating mock photometry for the Simba simulations, we find that the early metal enrichment history in Simba results in good agreement with the observed UV LF at z=6, but produces too much dust extinction at z=8 so the simulated LF is quite a bit low.  This raises the discussion of the possibility of early metal enrichment, which will be testable with future JWST observations (1911.06330).",https://youtu.be/RR_7hDkIaow,,"Reionization, Star formation histories, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory, Observations, Tools",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WkRvZ_I32pLLtnAfxLb_Hns9ExyjRvVy,No (included),

This effect produced a distinct BAO feature in the Reionization 21 cm power spectrum at wave numbers k∼0.1 h/Mpc, near which forthcoming surveys will be most sensitive. In contrast to the highly uncertain impact of streaming velocities on star formation, the effect on clumping can be calculated more precisely because it is set mainly by cosmology and straightforward gas dynamics.  I will discuss the impact of streaming velocities on IGM clumpiness, which we have quantified using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations.  I will also discuss the corresponding impact on the Reionization 21 cm signal.

However, the detection and imaging of 21cm line signal are difficult because the foreground and instrumental systematics are stronger than the expected signal. In order to overcome these obstacles, e propose a new cross correlation approach between observed 21cm-line data and 21cm-line images generated from the distribution of the Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) with the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). We employ the results of our numerical simulations to train the cGAN network so that the network can predict the 21cm-line map from LAE distribution. The cGAN network well reproduces 21cm-line brightness temperature maps and the neutral fraction maps at large scales. Furthermore, we find that the cross correlation is detectable at k<0.2 [1/Mpc] by combing MWA Phase II observation and LAE deep survey of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera.

The redshifted 21-cm signal from this epoch is expected to be highly non-Gaussian in nature due to the involvement of different complex astrophysical processes during this phase e.g. Lyman-alpha coupling, X-ray heating and photoionization. In this work we quantify this evolving non-Gaussianity expected in the signal through the signal bispectrum, while considering a variety of heating and ionizing source models in a suit of radiative transfer simulations of the signal. In this work for the first time we quantify the non-Gaussianity present in this signal by estimating bispectra for all possible unique k-triangles (previous works have considered bispectra for only a few specific k-triangles). Here we also quantify the impact of redshift space distortions, on the signal bispectra, which is an inherent line-of-sight anisotropy present in any observations of this signal. Our investigations show that different heating and ionizing source models affect the signal bispectra differently, based on the stage of the CD and the k-triangles for which the bispectra are being estimated. In case of different source models, even if the mean dT is the same, the sign, shape and amplitude of the bispectrum may differ for a specific k-triangle. Using a quasi-linear model for the 21-cm signal, we show that these differences are due to the different heating and Lyman-alpha coupling topologies in different source models. We find that the impact of the peculiar velocity on the 21-cm CD bispectra is significant, varying in the range ~20% - 200% based on the source model and k-modes for which the bispectra is being estimated. We further observe that the change in amplitude and sign of the bispectra are related to the topology of the redshifted 21-cm signal from this era.",https://youtu.be/x_N1VZCGQQc,,Reionization,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_itTxuSLxpUsHgwVgSvX8adTdzErBZAA,Yes,

The next-generation telescopes (such as SKA, HERA) will be able to directly probe the three dimensional distribution of neutral hydrogen from this era. After that, the aim will be to constrain the astrophysical parameter of EoR accurately, which is mainly done using Bayesian Inference. First generation telescopes try to observe the statistical behaviour of the 21-cm signal. Power spectrum is one of such statistics. However, the 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian in nature. Therefore, 21-cm power-spectrum is insufficient to give the fruit-full information hidden in the non-Gaussian features of the signal, a higher order statistics (i.e. 21-cm Bispectrum) can be a solution to this.
	Until the real signal being observed, EoR simulations are been used to study the EoR, Once we detect the signal, there are a number of theoretical EoR models which can be use to test the future observations, these models are mainly based upon numerical, semi-numerical simulations which take huge amount of time in Bayesian Inference. A promising alternative is to use supervised machine learning (Artificial Neural Networks) based on these models.
	Here we introduce EmuPBk, a python-keras based machine learning package which consists of some already trained artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on the semi-numerical simulation ReionYuga. We have taken a 215 cMpc volume simulation box for generating the matter distribution at redshift z=9.210. These ANNs emulate the 21-cm Powerspectrum and Bispectrum given 3 astrophysical EoR parameters (nion,rmfp,mhalo(min)). These ANNs are trained over 1000 test power spectrum and Bispectrum and further validated over 40 samples and tested over 18 samples.
We have achieved more than 98% and more than 96% accuracy in the predictions of Power spectrum and Bispectrum using these ANNs. 
we attempt to constrain the EoR parameters using sample variance as our covariance matrix for MCMC analysis.
Further, we have simulated SKA-low’s instrumental noise(as used by https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08706) for 1000 realizations, for 1000 and 5000 hours of observation time. The size of the noise-box is the same as used in the simulation. 
As EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian, 21-cm Bispectrum has constrained the EoR parameters more tighter than 21-cm Powespectum.

Here, we consider two different models of dark matter: cold dark matter (CDM) and thermal warm dark matter (WDM) , and study how they impact the epoch of reionization (EoR) and its 21-cm observables. Using a suite of simulations, we find that in the WDM scenarios, the structure formation on small scales gets suppressed resulting in a smaller number of low mass dark matter halos compared to the CDM scenario. Assuming that the efficiency of sources in producing ionizing photons remain the same, this leads to a lower number of total ionizing photons produced at any given cosmic time and thus in a delay in the reionization process. We also find visual differences in the neutral hydrogen (HI) topology and in 21-cm maps in case of the WDM compared to the CDM. However, differences in the 21-cm power spectra, at the same neutral fraction, are found to be small. Thus, we focus on the non-Gaussianity in the EoR 21-cm signal, quantified through its bispectrum. We find that the 21-cm bispectra (driven by the HI topology) are significantly different in WDM models when compared with CDM, even for same mass averaged neutral fractions. This establishes that the 21-cm bispectrum is a unique and promising way to differentiate between different dark matter models, and can be used to constrain the nature of the dark matter in the future EoR observations.

However, it is still not well-constrained at high redshifts, where most large surveys probe the rest-frame UV. Therefore, they do not directly probe the dust-obscured part of the SFRD density and rely on highly uncertain corrections for dust attenuation. The ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) was designed to measure the dust-obscured SFRD at 4<z<6.

Quantifying this requires to study in detail how much radiation is produced by stars and AGN, as well how much of it escapes from the host galaxy to the intergalactic medium.
Because of their accelerated evolution, protoclusters are unique laboratories to study the complex processes governing galaxy formation and evolution in the high redshift Universe. As black hole growth is thought to be favoured in these environments, studying the assembly of protoclusters and in particular how their galaxies and black holes grow together can provide unique insights in the properties of the sources of reionization.

Understanding the nature of the ionizing sources, the associated ionization of the IGM, and its impact on subsequent structure formation and galaxy evolution by means of radiative feedback effects, represent key outstanding questions in current astrophysics. We aim to tackle these questions by performing simulations of galaxy evolution and reionization. For this purpose, we have developed the new framework ASTRAEUS that couples a semi-analytical galaxy evolution model with a semi-numerical reionization scheme and uses the merger trees and density distribution of a dark matter-only N-body simulation. This model includes key processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas accretion, mergers, star formation, supernovae and radiative feedback, and describes 
the spatial ionization of the IGM accounting for inhomogeneous recombinations that follow the spatial density distribution and ionization history. 
In order to investigate the interplay between galaxy evolution and reionization, we have implemented different models of radiative feedback and studied its impact on observables such as the UV luminosity function or the 21cm signal from the neutral regions in the IGM during reionization.

While observations suggest that this transition was complete by redshift ∼ 6, the exact history of this process remains unknown. One method for measuring the evolution of the neutral gas fraction throughout this epoch is via observing the Lyα damping wings of high-redshift quasars. In order to constrain the neutral fraction from quasar observations, one needs an accurate model of the quasar spectrum around Lyα, after the spectrum has been processed by its host galaxy but before it is altered by absorption and damping in the intervening IGM. This talk presents a novel machine learning approach, using artificial neural networks, to reconstruct quasar continua around Lyα, which improves on the state-of-the-art model in the literature by 14.2% on average. By further applying our method to two high-redshift quasars, ULAS J1120+0641 at z = 7.0851 and ULAS J1342+0928 at z = 7.5413, we present the first machine-learning-based reionization constraints, which are consistent with the literature and favour a rapid end to reionization.",https://youtu.be/0w7hlW3APk4,,"Reionization, Tools",,,

This analysis can now be carried out for 8 objects at the highest accessible redshifts (z~6), where data of sufficient quality exist. MUSE is particularly efficient for revealing extended low-surface brightness Lyα halos, and the CGM surrounding a sample of QSOs at z~6 was mapped for the first time in Drake+19. This fundamentally changed our understanding of the evolution of these objects by showing that QSOs in the first Gyr of the Universe are already surrounded by giant Lyα-emitting structures,  on the contrary to previous speculation in the literature. We reported spatial morphologies and sizes of 4 Lyα halos — the nebulae are each asymmetric on-sky and reach maximum extents of 27 − 60 pkpc from the quasar positions. Each halo shows a broad Lyα line, and a high velocity width. In contrast, ALMA observations of QSOs at similar redshifts typically reveal compact [CII] emission of narrow line-width from the host-galaxies. Another example, at z = 4.7, is the BR1202-0725 system comprised of a QSO-SMG pair, for which we have recently mapped a giant Lyα halo extending ~8 arcsec (~55 pkpc) on-sky, and compared it to the system’s [CII] properties, including the purported [CII] ‘bridge’ between the two massive objects (Drake+, submitted). Each of these QSOs present ideal targets for JWST IFU observations, which will be the first instrument capable of mapping extended Hα emission coincident with very high-redshift Lyα halos, to unambiguously determine the gas kinematics, and powering mechanisms of these spectacular halos, and to connect them to the physical conditions within the host galaxies.

This directly probes stellar light and ionized hydrogen, however fails to properly account for any dust-obscured star-formation.

In particular, I will focus on one such galaxy, MACS0416_Y1, where an ALMA detection of [OIII] confirmed its spectroscopic redshift to be z = 8.312. Modelling of its UV-to-FIR spectrum suggests both a young (age ~ 4 Myr) and old stellar component (z ~ 14) in a moderately high metallicity LBG (Z ~ 0.2 Zsun). Evidence points towards an actively star-forming system, with indications of the onset of star-formation feedback through supernovae. For example, the [CII] velocity profile suggests either a rotation-dominated system, or strong outflows that can rapidly quench star-formation within the galaxy, in line with recent hydrodynamic models.

It has been argued that in order to rapidly grow these SMBHs in such short amounts of cosmic time, they need to accrete matter over timescales comparable to the age of the universe, and thus the lifetime of quasars - the integrated time that galaxies shine as active quasars - is expected to be of order ~10^9 yr at z~6, even if they accrete continuously at the Eddington limit. 
I will present a new method to obtain model-independent constraints on the lifetime of high-redshift quasars with unprecedented precision, based on measurements of the sizes of ionized regions around quasars, known as proximity zones. The sizes of these proximity zones are sensitive to the lifetime of the quasars, because the intergalactic gas has a finite response time to the quasars’ radiation. Applying this method to quasar spectra at z>6, we discover an unexpected population of very young quasars, indicating lifetimes of only ~10,000 years, which poses significant challenges on current black hole formation models. I will show results from our on-going multi-wavelength survey to detect and characterize young quasars and their environments. Furthermore, I will discuss several modifications to the current SMBH formation paradigm that might explain our results, e.g. super-critical mass accretion rates, massive initial black hole seeds in excess of stellar remnants, or highly obscured quasar growth phases.

However, as the UV emission is preferably absorbed and scattered by dust grains, understanding the dust attenuation properties and dust obscured star formation activity is essential for a complete picture of the early Universe. In this talk, we present our recent studies on the dust attenuation properties of star forming galaxies at z~5 using the UV spectral slope (β) and InfRared eXcess (IRX=L_IR/L_UV) i.e. IRX-β relation, based on the recent ALMA large program ALPINE. We found a lower IRX at fixed β compared to the locally calibrated relations, indicating a rapid evolution of dust attenuation properties at z>5. Similarly, we found galaxies at z~5 have lower IRX values up to 1 dex on average at fixed mass compared to previously studied IRX-M* relations at z<4. This implies a lower obscured fraction of star-formation than at lower redshifts.

The effective radius r_e,[CII] exceeds r_e,UV by factors of ~2-3 and the ratio of r_e,[CII]/r_e,UV increases as a function of M_star. We do not find strong evidence that [CII] line, the rest-frame UV, and FIR continuum are always displaced over ~ 1-kpc scale from each other. We identify 30% of isolated ALPINE sources as having an extended [CII] component over 10-kpc scales detected at 4.1 σ -10.9 σ  beyond the size of rest-frame UV and far-infrared (FIR) continuum. One object has tentative rotating features up to ~10-kpc, where the 3D model fit shows the rotating [CII]-gas disk spread over 4 times larger than the rest-frame UV-emitting region.

Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters allows to probe z~6-7 galaxies down to 10⁶ solar masses, providing valuable constraints on the very low-mass end of the mass function. Until the JWST comes online however these galaxies can only be observed in a few broad-band HST and Spitzer/IRAC filters, making the derivation of their stellar mass particularly difficult, i.e. requiring assumptions on parameters such as star-forming history, stellar age, dust content, metallicity, etc. In my presentation I will present our recent work on the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function at z=6-7 using the gravitational magnification of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters.

Constraining the neutral gas properties of local analogues of the first galaxies provides valuable insights to understand how ionizing photons escape star-forming galaxies and explain the astrophysics required to reionize the Universe. We recently investigated the connection between the ISM porosity (characterized by the H I covering fraction), the Lyman alpha properties and the escape of LyC photons in a sample of 22 star-forming galaxies, including 12 confirmed LyC leakers. We found that the presence of low-density channels shapes the Lyman alpha profile, is the origin of the strong Lyman alpha emission, and enables the escape of ionizing photons in low-z leakers. Hence, the porosity of the ISM is a crucial property to understand the leakage of Lyman alpha and LyC photons. I will additionally discuss how the Lyman alpha properties and the low-ionization metal absorption lines, such as Si II, can indirectly probe the neutral gas properties in high-z galaxies and estimate the escape of ionizing photons.

The observed sudden drop in Ly$\alpha$ fraction at $z>6$ is often interpreted as a sign of reionization, since the IGM is more neutral and opaque, which reduces Ly$\alpha$ photon transmission. Crucially, this interpretation of the observations is only valid under the assumption that galaxies themselves experience a minimal evolution at these epochs. By modelling Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects in and around galaxies, we examine whether a change in the galactic properties can reproduce the observed drop in the Ly$\alpha$ fraction. We find that an increase in the galactic neutral hydrogen content or a reduction in the outflow velocity toward higher redshift both lead to a lower Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and can thus mimic an increasing neutral fraction. We furthermore find, however, that this change in galactic properties leads to systematically different Lya spectra which can be used to differentiate the two competing effects. Our results caution the use of Ly$\alpha$ observations to estimate IGM neutral fraction, without accounting for the potential change in the galactic properties, e.g., by mapping out the evolution of Ly$\alpha$ spectral characteristics.",https://youtu.be/ZSBP0eC4-pk,,"Reionization, First stars, AGN, Star formation histories, Theory, Observations",,,

However, the sample of galaxy observations at z>4 that featured the sensitivity and resolution for rotational analysis or resolved dynamical characterization has been small.

However, not only has it proved challenging to identify such systems, but it also remains uncertain whether the low-redshift LyC leakers are true ""analogues"" of the sources that reionized the Universe. To address this, we use high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations to examine whether simulated galaxies in the epoch of reionization share similar emission-line properties to observed LyC leakers at z∼3 and z∼0 . We find that the simulated galaxies with high LyC escape fractions ( fesc ) often exhibit high O32 and populate the same regions of the R23-O32 plane as z∼3 LyC leakers. However, we show that viewing angle, metallicity, and ionisation parameter can all impact where a galaxy resides on the O32- fesc plane. Based on emission line diagnostics and how they correlate with fesc , lower-metallicity LyC leakers at z∼3 appear to be good analogues of reionization-era galaxies.

We use our simulated galaxies to develop multiple new diagnostics to identify LyC leakers using IR and nebular emission lines. We show that our model using only [CII] 158μm and [OIII] 88μm can identify potential leakers from non-leakers from the local Dwarf Galaxy Survey.

However, their number density has not been well determined, making it difficult to assess their role in the early ionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we present the updated results of our z ~ 5 quasar survey using the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), a near-infrared imaging survey covering an area of 85 deg^2. From our spectroscopic observations with the GMOS on the Gemini-South 8 m Telescope, we discovered eight new quasars at z ~ 5 with -26.1 < M1450 < -23.3. Combining our IMS faint quasars (M1450 > -27 mag) with the brighter SDSS quasars (M1450 < -27 mag), we derive, for the first time, the z ~ 5 quasar luminosity function (QLF) without any fixed parameters down to the magnitude limit of M1450 = -23 mag. We find that the faint-end slope of the QLF is very flat (alpha = -1.3), with a characteristic luminosity of M1450* = -25.8 mag. The number density of z ~ 5 quasars from the QLF gives lower ionizing emissivity at 912 A and ionizing photon density than previous studies, and they discredit the idea that quasars alone could have ionized the IGM.",https://youtu.be/ajGs45eN3oU,,"Reionization, AGN, Observations",,,

Recently, some studies have suggested a moderate evolution of LAE fraction (De Barros et al. 2017; Pentericci et al. 2018) than previously reported (e,g, Stark et al. 2011; Tilvi et al. 2014). These measurements and their interpretation are still strongly debated. In this talk, I will present new results combining deep HST and MUSE data. We use the Hubble Ultra Deep Field catalog from Rafelski et al. (2015) to construct a UV-selected sample of galaxies with photometric redshifts z~3 to 6, which is the first UV-complete sample to study the LAE fraction. We measure Lya emission with the deep IFU data from the MUSE HUDF survey homogeneously over the wide redshift range (e.g., Bacon et al. 2017). We find low values of the LAE fraction ~10-20% and confirm a moderate increase as a function of redshift from z~3 to 6, for galaxies brighter than MUV = -17.75 AB. We do not find a significant dependence of the LAE fraction on UV magnitude from -22 to -18 mag at z~3-4, and our value is lower than those in the literature at faint UV magnitude. The difference can be explained by an LBG selection bias which we discuss quantitatively. Comparing our results with a galaxy evolution model (Garel et al. 2015), we find that the cosmic variance does not affect our results. Our results suggest either a lower increase of the LAE fraction towards z~6 than previously suggested, or even a turnover of the LAE fraction at z~5.5 which may be the signature of a late or patchy reionization process.",https://youtu.be/kYFKXN_gzZI,,"Reionization, Observations",,,

If massive galaxies were dusty during the EoR, there could be important implications for observations of the UVLF, but also for the ionising photon budget, by potentially reducing the fraction of LyC photons that can escape dusty galaxies. We aim to investigate this possible impact of dust on galaxies during Reionization. In order to do so, we implemented the physical models for dust creation and destruction from Dubois et al. (in prep) in the fully coupled RHD RAMSES-CUDATON code (Ocvirk et al. 2016,2020),  which we used to simulate cosmological volumes during the EoR. Dust absorption of LyC photons is computed on the fly during radiative transfer steps. We calibrate our models so as to produce galaxies with realistic dust to stellar mass ratios and UV continuum slopes. We then post-process the simulations to determine the dust escape fractions and UVLF with extinction. We find that dust extinction affects the UVLF for MAB1600<-18.

In CoDa, optically thick star forming regions in massive halo result in low LyC escape fractions, that decrease with halo mass. We show that by including simple physical models for dust creation and destruction, we produce realistic UV continuum slopes (beta), halo gas masses, halo dust to metal ratios Thus, we can account for dust extinction when computing luminosity functions, and the escape fractions of halos.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), with their extraordinary capability, enable us to search for the emission lines from the ionized, atomic, and molecular interstellar medium(ISM). In this conference, I will present our recent ALMA and NOEMA observations of the multi-phase ISM (e.g., the CO, H2O, OH+ , [OI] 146um, and [NII] 122um lines) from a FIR bright z=6.00 quasar SDSS J231038.88+185519.7 (J2310+1855). The goal is to understand the physical conditions and the heating mechanisms of the ISM in this quasar. I will present a CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) study of this quasar, to probe the physical conditions of the molecular ISM. Complemented with previous [CII] 158um and [OIII] 88um observations, ratios between line emissions from the ionized and neutral gas are used to probe the ISM properties. Comparisons with molecular line observations of local (U)LIRGs, AGNs, and high redshift SMGs suggest that J2310+1855 (i) exhibits higher CO excitation for J ≥ 8; (ii) reveals higher H2O/IR, H2O/CO and OH+ /H2O ratios. These suggest that mechanisms besides UV radiation (e.g., shocks, cosmic rays or X-rays) are responsible for the molecular gas heating and ionization. As for the line emissions from the ionized and atomic ISM, J2310+1855 shows a comparable [OIII] 88um/[NII] 122um ratio with local systems, which suggests a metallicity of Z/Z⊙=1.5−2.1. The low [CII] 158um/[OI] 146um ratio (comparable to the lowest values found in local (U)LIRGs), in addition to a [OI] 146um /FIR ratio >2× that expected from the local relation, indicates no [OI] 146um deficit, revealing warm and dense gas possibly heated by the AGN.",https://youtu.be/wzilV6B1b6c,,AGN,,,

Faint star-forming galaxies are leading candidates because they are found to be numerous and may have significant ionizing photon escape fractions (fesc). In this talk I will update this picture via an empirical model that successfully predicts latest observations (e.g., the rapid drop in star-formation density (ρSFR at z > 8). We generate an ionizing spectrum for each galaxy in our model and constrain fesc by leveraging latest measurements of the reionization timeline (e.g., Lyα damping of quasars and galaxies at z > 7). We find MUV < -13.5 galaxies need an average fesc of 0.2 to complete reionization. The inferred IGM neutral fraction is [0.9, 0.5, 0.1] at z=[8.2,6.8,6.2] ± 0.2 - that is, the bulk of reionization transpires rapidly in 300 Myr, driven by the z > 8 ρSFR and favored by high neutral fractions (∼60%-90%) measured at z ∼ 7-8. We propose a physically motivated model relating fesc to ΣSFR and find fesc scales as ΣSFR^{0.4±0.1}. Since ΣSFR falls by ∼2.5 dex between z = 8 and z = 0, our model explains the humble upper limits on fesc at lower redshifts and its required evolution to fesc ∼ 0.2 at z > 6. Within this model, strikingly, <5% of galaxies with MUV <-18 and log(M⋆/M☉) >8 (the ""oligarchs"") account for >80% of the reionization budget - a stark departure from the canonical ""democratic"" reionization led by copious faint sources. In fact, faint sources (MUV > -16) must be relegated to a limited role in order to ensure high neutral fractions at z = 7-8. Shallow faint-end slopes of the UV luminosity function (α>-2) and/or fesc distributions skewed toward massive galaxies produce the required late and rapid reionization. I will end by discussing new observational constraints on the escape fraction from the Hubble Deep UV Survey (HDUV) and deep VLT/X-Shooter spectroscopy at z~2-3 that support this picture.",https://youtu.be/5R2_otc2lTU,,"Reionization, Escape fractions, Theory, Observations",,,

One possibility is that the most opaque regions at these redshifts contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen. This explanation, which abandons the common assumption that reionization ended before z = 6. Here we explore a model in which the neutral fraction is still ≈ 10% at z = 5.5. We confirm that this model can account for the observed scatter in Lyα forest opacities, as well as the observed Lyβ transmission in the J0148 trough. We contrast the model with a competing “earlier” reionization scenario characterized by a short mean free path and large fluctuations in the post-reionization ionizing background. We consider Lyα and Lyβ effective optical depths, their correlations, trough size distributions, dark pixel fractions, the IGM thermal history, and spatial distributions of Lyman-α emitters around forest sight lines. We find that the models are broadly similar in almost all of these statistics, suggesting that it may be difficult to distinguish between them definitively.

The VPF is sensitive to voids and can be easily compared for samples of the same number density, and therefore might be the best option for teasing out the particular clustering caused by 'inside-out' patchy reionization.

To this end, surveys of redshift z>9 galaxies have revealed several sources for which especially red Spitzer/IRAC colours unambiguously reveal the presence of a significant rest-frame 4000 A Balmer break, indicative of mature stellar populations which can greatly aid in constraining the timing of Cosmic Dawn. However, at lower redshifts of z~7-9 the cause of such red Spitzer/IRAC colours is not so clear cut, given degeneracies caused by the contamination of the filters by strong (EW>1000 A) [OIII]5007 A + Hbeta nebular emission lines indicative of gas excited by young stellar populations. Thus, distinguishing between the two scenarios is a prerequisite towards determining the prevalence of Balmer break objects at z>7 and, for the brightest sources, placing tighter constraints on a potential steepening of the cosmic SFR density at z>8 indicative of younger galaxy ages. To address this, we select and perform detailed SED fitting of the brightest (MUV~-21.5 AB), spectroscopically-confirmed sources at z>~7-9, which display especially red Spitzer/IRAC colours and for which ALMA [OIII] 88 micron data is available. We explore whether the inclusion of the ALMA data, and in particular the [OIII] 88 micron emission line, can break the colour degeneracy and reveal the Balmer break contributions to the NIR photometry for our sources. Our modelling finds the photometry of half our sample of 4 z>7 galaxies are dominated by Balmer break contributions and stellar ages >100 Myrs, while the rest can be explained with strong nebular emission lines and stellar ages <10 Myr.

With JWST it will be possible to measure the required quantities at very high redshift, enabling us to apply this relation to galaxies in the EoR. When combined with observerations of the targets actual Lya output this would allow the estimation of the approximate IGM transmission to a given galaxy and potentially determinations of IGM opacity on a sightline-to-sightline basis. Using resolved information from Lya spectroscopy can also help constrain IGM transmission and the progress of the EoR.

Leveraging unique direct-method constraints on the nebular metallicity, I utilize photoionization modeling to constrain the ionization parameters and ionizing source properties of these galaxies, finding that very hard ionizing spectra are required, likely a result of alpha-enhanced massive stars due to short galaxy formation timescales.  Even with JWST, it will not be feasible to obtain deep enough rest-optical and rest-UV spectra to detect these auroral lines in typical EoR sources.

Additionally, the CIV and MgII line velocity shifts with respect to the quasar host's [CII] emission are significantly correlated, indicating a common physical origin.

However, the dust temperature, Td, remains unconstrained thereby introducing large uncertainties, in the derived dust masses, total infrared luminosities, obscured star formation fraction. We present new results showing a clear trend of increasing dust temperature in early galaxies, mostly driven by the compact and turbulent nature of these systems. A higher Td has testable implications: (a) it reduces the tension between local and high-z IRX-β relation, (b) it alleviates the problem of the uncomfortably large dust masses deduced from observations of some EoR galaxies.

We fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption lines in a composite Keck spectrum. The measured maximum outflow velocity at z~5-6 is vmax = 700^{+180}_{-110} km/s on average, which is higher than those at z=0 by a factor of 3 and comparable to z=2, at M*~10^{10.1} Mo. Interestingly, vmax shows a clear positive correlation with SFR and vcir, the halo circular velocity estimated from the stellar masses, for galaxies with M*=10^{10.0-10.8} Mo at z=0-6 with ~0.1 dex scatters. This positive correlation with vcir is in good agreement with theoretical predictions and suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related to the halo circular velocity.

Rest-frame UV spectroscopy of galaxies at z > 6 has revealed peculiar spectral properties. Detections of intense CIII] and CIV line emission (EW > 15 - 20 A) in z > 6 systems indicate a hard ionizing spectrum that is not seen in typical star forming galaxies at lower redshifts, while its origin remains a matter of debate. Luminous galaxies with extremely large [OIII]+H-beta EW (> 1000 A) at z > 7 have been shown to have much stronger Lyman-alpha emission than the general population at z > 7. This result has proved puzzling given the strong attenuation expected from the partially neutral IGM at z ~ 7 - 9. To interpret the emerging results at z > 6, a comprehensive investigation of the spectral properties of reionization-era analogs is required. I have conducted a near-infrared spectroscopic survey targeting rest-frame optical emission lines in 250 extreme [OIII] emitters at z ~ 1 - 3 where they can be studied in much greater detail. These systems show low stellar masses and large specific star formation rates that are similar to galaxies in the reionization-era. I have recently followed it up with a large Magellan and MMT spectroscopic survey targeting rest-frame UV metal lines (CIII], OIII], CIV) and Lyman-alpha emission lines. I will present the latest results from this survey. I find that the CIII] EW increases with [OIII]+H-beta EW, but I also find a large dispersion in CIII] EW at the largest [OIII]+H-beta EW. I will comment on how gas-phase metallicity may impact the CIII] EW variation, and discuss the implications for the intense CIII] emission seen at z > 6. Finally, I will show that strong Lyman-alpha emission (EW > 25 A) becomes more common in galaxies with larger [OIII]+H-beta EW, and discuss the implications for the Lyman-alpha visibility at z > 7.",https://youtu.be/J2hhe26gSic,,"Reionization, Observations",,,

From simulations of stellar evolution, we expect low mass Population III stars to yield low values of the 12C/13C ratio. In this talk I will present the first bound on the carbon isotope ratio 12C/13C in one of the least polluted reservoirs of gas in the Universe. For the Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system found towards J0035-0918, log 12C/13C > 0.37 (95 per cent confidence). We can therefore rule out the strong presence of 13C in this system. Using the abundance pattern of this DLA, and a model of stochastic chemical enrichment (Welsh et al. 2019), I have investigated whether low mass Population III stars have contributed to the enrichment of this system. Additionally, by considering the lifetimes of the enriching stars, I have investigated the timescale on which this DLA has been enriched.

Due to the high opacity of the IGM during this epoch, studying this period is difficult, yet it could reveal much about the traits of early galaxies. In this work, we demonstrate that reionization may also be studied through analysis of metal line absorption systems such as those seen in quasar spectra, arising from enriched gas in the CGM and IGM, complementary to methods focused solely on neutral hydrogen. To accomplish this, we use cosmological simulations of the EoR, including on-the-fly multi-frequency radiative transfer, using the Technicolor Dawn code. Through generation of mock quasar sightlines and simulated spectra, we analyze metrics of metal absorption and other gas parameters to reveal their connection to the process of reionization. Additionally, by incorporating several stellar population synthesis models, including one with binary stars, we examine how differing stellar emissivities impact the timing of reionization and the preferred ionization states of metals in the enriched CGM and IGM. We find that the ionization states of common absorbing transitions are sensitive to the amplitude and spectral shape of the ionizing background, suggesting that careful observations of these systems will place constraints on the nature of the primary contributors to reionization, particularly whether quasars could have played a major part. Further, we determine the redshift evolution of metals is dependent on the ionizing background and, through abundance ratios of neutral oxygen and silicon, can be directly tied to the neutral fraction of hydrogen, assisting in studies of the timing of reionization. Finally, we show that while the harder spectra of binary stars can affect elemental ionization states and lead to an accelerated reionization history, it can also lead to decreased star formation rate density through gas heating, and subsequently altered levels of enrichment in gas and stars. This work reveals a complex interplay between several simulation parameters, and also highlights the usefulness of metal line studies at z>5.",https://youtu.be/zXgY13A0so0,,"Reionization, Metal/dust enrichment, Theory",,,

We show that while the Lyα equivalent width (EW(Lyα)) and the Lyα escape fraction are not significantly correlated with the central SFI (S250pc), both are positively correlated with the ratio of surface brightness to galaxy stellar mass (S250pc/Mstar), with correlation coefficients (p-values) of 0.702 (1×10-8)and 0.529 (5×10-4) with EW(Lyα) and the Lyα escape fraction, respectively.

So it is imperative to build a model to accurately predict LyC emission using the observable properties of galaxies in the reionization era. In recent years, studies have shown that the Lya emission from galaxies may be correlated to LyC emission. In this study we have studied this correlation by analyzing thousands of galaxies in the cosmological radiation - hydrodynamical simulation SPHINX. We have post-processed these galaxies with Lya radiative transfer code RASCAS, taking into account both recombination and collision as sources of Lya. We have found that around z = 6, there is a strong correlation between both output and input Lya and LyC luminosities of galaxies. There is also a positive correlation between Lya and LyC escape fractions in the brightest Lya emitters as found in observational studies, but when we include the entire population of galaxies, combining fainter LAEs with the brighter ones, the correlation is not significant. The same pattern is found in galaxies at higher redshifts too. In the next step, we have built a model using multiple linear regression method and have shown that given the physical properties and the Lya luminosity and escape fraction, we can predict its output LyC luminosity and LyC escape fraction with a high degree of accuracy.

Our knowledge of galaxies during this epoch is still in its infancy, but what little we know hints that these galaxies emit copious UV radiation, powered by massive stars with low metal content and significant ionization. While the Lyman-alpha line is the UV gold standard for finding galaxies during this epoch, the resonant line is highly sensitive to neutral Hydrogen -- often pushing the redshift derived from this line hundreds of km/s redwards of the true redshift. However, the rest-UV spectra of galaxies contain a rich variety of nebular metal emission lines which can trace the systemic redshift of these distant sources, and contain highly valuable information about the massive stars and physical conditions in galaxies during this epoch. Such UV nebular lines are targetable at these redshifts, yet have been unexplored except in rare, individual cases.

One scenario allows reionization to start late and complete rapidly, where moderately luminous galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget (Robertson et al. 2015). Another scenario allows a smooth temporal evolution of reionization, where very faint galaxies, common at early times, dominate the photon budget (Finkelstein et al. 2019). These models differ drastically in their predictions for the ionized fraction at z~9 (~20% vs. ~60%), and our recent MOSFIRE program has sought Lyα emission at this epoch to distinguish between these two possibilities. We have implemented improved data reduction and stacking of spectra, which accounts for the drift of objects in the slits throughout the night, and unknown offsets of our objects from the expected location in the slit.

The main contributors to the ionizing ultraviolet (UV) flux during reionization are likely to be young star-forming galaxies, as active galactic nuclei alone appear to be insufficient. Neutral gas along the line of sight to distant galaxies acts as an opaque veil to this ionizing radiation, preventing us from measuring it directly at z>~5. Therefore, identifying galaxies as close to this redshift as possible that exhibit escaping ionizing flux, observed as continuum below the Lyman break at λ < 912 A, is imperative to understanding cosmic reionization. We present a sample of high-redshift (z=3-5) Lyman continuum (LyC) galaxies (LCGs). This elusive population has previously been overlooked in most searches for high-redshift star-forming galaxies, typically selected with the classic Lyman break technique, due to the non-zero flux where a break is expected. We are developing a novel and less biased selection method for finding individual high-redshift LCGs that is proving to be an effective way to identify this rare population. We present the results from our successful pilot study to search for LCGs in the COSMOS field. COSMOS was selected for its extensive multi-band photometric coverage, including high-resolution optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and accurate (Δz~2%) 30-band photometric redshifts from the ZFOURGE survey.

We spectroscopically confirmed four individual high-redshift LCGs in our HST footprints, demonstrating our method as a highly-effective strategy for identifying a statistically significant sample of individual LCGs.
